    ```

4. **Build the project:**
    ```sh

    ```

5. **Run the application:**
First run the npm run build command and then the sprint boot command (Tip: You may use 2 terminals for this in same directory)
    ```sh
    npm run build
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

6. **Access the application:**
    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.
